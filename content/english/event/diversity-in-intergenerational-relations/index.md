title: Diversity in Intergenerational Relations
summary: A talk by Beate Schwarz and Pirmin Pfammatter
abstract: Immigrant parents deal with more challenges and hardships bringing up
  their children in a host country compared to native parents. They work longer
  hours for less money and usually leave their social support network in the
  home country. Growing up, their children experience their parents sacrificing
  for them, which may foster feelings of indebtedness to the parents (i.e. Sense
  of Indebtedness, SIP). SIP may predict giving support (i.e. spending time
  together, helping with household chores) to the parents, when they grow old.
  In this study, SIP was adapted and applied to a culturally diverse sample of
  Swiss second-generation immigrants. A strong positive association of SIP with
  support given to parents was found. SIP explains specific aspects of
  intergenerational family dynamics in immigrant families.
