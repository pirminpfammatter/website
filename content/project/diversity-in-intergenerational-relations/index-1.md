In this project we study cultural diversity in family and non-family intergenerational relationships of immigrants in Switzerland. We focused on different topics: The first topics was to collect best practice examples of culture sensitive care and present them at the IAGGER conference in Goetheburg, Sweden. The second topic was a survey on the intgenerational relations, in which we studied the role of biculturalism, norms, values and feelings such as guilt in explaining support that adult immigrants give to their parents and the adult immigrants mental health.
