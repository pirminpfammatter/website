title: Intergenerational Relationships of Second Generation Immigrants
abstract: >-
  This talk by Beate Schwarz and Pirmin Pfammatter addressed the
  intergenerational relations of adult second-generation immigrants.

  Switzerland has a long, thought partially ambivalent relationship with their immigrant groups. This talk adresses the role of orientation 

  toward the heritage and the host culture in subjective well-being and the role of experienced conflicts in the relationship toward parents in the explanation of support, that adult immigrants give to their parents
