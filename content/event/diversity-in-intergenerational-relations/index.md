title: "Diversity in Intergenerational Relations"

summary: A talk by Beate Schwarz and Pirmin Pfammatter
abstract: In this talk we address the role of acculturation in the perceived
family value consensus that adult immigrants experience. We further addressed 
the role of this consensus for the relationship quality to both parents, and the
amount of support children give to their parents, when they grow older
location: Zurich University of Applied Sciences.
