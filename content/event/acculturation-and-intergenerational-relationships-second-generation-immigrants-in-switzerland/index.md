title: "Acculturation and Intergenerational Relationships: Second-Generation
  Immigrants in Switzerland"
summary: A talk by Beate Schwarz and Pirmin Pfammatter
abstract: >
  Second-generation immigrants grew up in the host culture  and develop a strong
  competence in this culture. At the same time, they are still influenced by the
  culture of their parents. When parents get older, their need for support of
  the adult children increases. Less is known, in how far orientation toward the
  host and the ethnic culture contribute to the exchange of support within a
  family. With respect to the model of intergenerational relationship of
  Bengtson and colleagues, norms and values might mediate between acculturation
  and provision of support . We investigated the relation between acculturation
  and social support provided to parents. Further, we tested the mediating
  effect of filial obligations for the association of acculturation and social
  support to parents. *N* = 371 adult second-generation immigrants (born in Switzerland or immigrated before the age of six) participated in the study (age *M*=33.1, *SD* = 10.6; 59% females). Ethnic origin varied widely in the sample, most were from southern Europe (24%) and former Yugoslavia (23%). Acculturation was measured by ethnic and host culture orientation. Filial obligations (FO) was assessed by five items on adult childrenâ€™s expectations. The questionnaire of social support included emotional, instrumental, and financial support provided to parents. Structural equation modelling revealed a mediating effect of FO for the positive association between ethnic culture orientation and social support but no mediation effect for the negative association between host culture orientation and social support. The discussion considers the importance of orientation to the ethnic culture of the second generation in order to secure the support of the elderly parents.
